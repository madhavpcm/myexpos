Release Buffer takes as input the number of a buffer page to be released and the PID of a process. Release Buffer function invalidates the LOCKING PID field (store -1) in the buffer table entry corresponding to the given buffer number. Release Buffer also wakes up all processes waiting for the buffer with given buffer number by changing the STATE in the process table from tuple (WAIT_BUFFER, buffer number) to READY.
